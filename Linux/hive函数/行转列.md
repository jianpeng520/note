## 1.建表
```
create table amount
(
y int,
q string,
amt int
);
```
## 2.插入数据
```
insert into amount 
values
(2019,'Q1',5743),
(2019,'Q2',3452),
(2019,'Q3',1235),
(2019,'Q4',3414),
(2020,'Q1',5621),
(2020,'Q2',5721),
(2020,'Q3',4523),
(2020,'Q4',3423);
```
## 3.上面的效果转成下面的效果
y          Q1       Q2      Q3     Q4
2019   5743
2020   5621

### --方法1：case  when
```
select 
y,
sum(case when q = 'Q1' then amt else 0 end) as Q1,
sum(case when q = 'Q2' then amt else 0 end) as Q2,
sum(case when q = 'Q3' then amt else 0 end) as Q3,
sum(case when q = 'Q4' then amt else 0 end) as Q4
from amount
group by y;
```
### --方法2：if
```
select 
y,
sum(if(q = 'Q1', amt, 0)) as Q1,
sum(if(q = 'Q2', amt, 0)) as Q2,
sum(if(q = 'Q3', amt, 0)) as Q3,
sum(if(q = 'Q4', amt, 0)) as Q4
from amount
group by y;
```
### --方法3：collect_list
```
select 
y,
collect_list(amt)[0] as Q1,
collect_list(amt)[1] as Q2,
collect_list(amt)[2] as Q3,
collect_list(amt)[3] as Q4
from(select * from amount order by y, q) t
group by y;
```
