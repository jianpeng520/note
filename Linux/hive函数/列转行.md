## 1.构造表
```
create table amount2
as
select 
y,
sum(if(q = 'Q1', amt, 0)) as Q1,
sum(if(q = 'Q2', amt, 0)) as Q2,
sum(if(q = 'Q3', amt, 0)) as Q3,
sum(if(q = 'Q4', amt, 0)) as Q4
from amount
group by y;
```
## 2.方法1：union all
```
select y,   'Q1' as q ,  q1 as amt from amount2
union all
select y,   'Q2' as q ,  q2 as amt from amount2
union all
select y,   'Q3' as q ,  q3 as amt from amount2
union all
select y,   'Q4' as q ,  q4 as amt from amount2；
```
## 3.方法2：explode + map
`select y, map('Q1', q1, 'Q2', q2,'Q3', q3,'Q4', q4) from amount2;`

`select y, q, amt from amount2`
`lateral view explode(map('Q1', q1, 'Q2', q2,'Q3', q3,'Q4', q4)) t as q, amt;`
